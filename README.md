# react-native-block
A simple and customizable view component for React Native.
## Usage
It's a nice to have component on your common component folder.  
Instead of writing this: 
```js
<View style={{ flex: 2, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', marginTop: 20 }}>
  //Other components
</View>
```
You can just do this:

```
<Block flex={2} center middle mt={20}>
  // Your components
</Block>
```
